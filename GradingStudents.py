# HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

# Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  to .
# Any  less than  is a failing grade.
# Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

# If the difference between the  and the next multiple of  is less than , round  up to the next multiple of .
# If the value of  is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
# Examples

# grade=84 round to  (85 - 84 is less than 3)
# grade=29 do not round (result is less than 40)
# grade=57 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)
# Given the initial value of  for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process.

# Function Description

# Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below.

# gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

# int grades[n]: the grades before rounding
# Returns

# int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate
# Input Format

# The first line contains a single integer, , the number of students.
